# FAIRness-Evaluation-of-NCBI-Hackathon-Digital-Objects-using-FAIRshake

## Premise
Assess the FAIRness of NCBI-Hackathon Tools on GitHub (and possibly DockStore)

## Abstract

FAIR ( ) has traditionally been linked to the concept of biomedical research data, however, the concept of FAIR should be applied more broadly to include tools use to analyze and process data. There needs to be more emphasis on facilitating sharing of data analysis tools and workflows to truly facilitate reproducibility. Indeed, there is a plethora of tools with more being created every day. The field lacks a centralized tool repository to store tools/workflows (as well as their associated standards/languages) and assess the usability/reusuability of said tools.

In this project, we use the FAIRshake Tool (EXPLAIN THIS LATER) to conduct an assessment of how FAIR tools really are. We will be scanning NCBI GitHub (and possibly Dockstore). Such an assessment is important for the following reasons: 
1. Assists future users searching for tools by displaying a fairSHAKE badge for the tool in question
2. Alerts tool owners to potential pitfalls that may prevent futute users using their tools 
3. Allows adminstrators to automatically assess the overall usability or FAIRness of a suite of tools

## Challenges and Assumptions
We have chosen to assess tools based on metrics that can be automatically assessed through script rather than subject tool owners and site admins to manual curation/assessment of tools.
