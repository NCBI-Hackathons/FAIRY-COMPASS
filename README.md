Abstract

FAIR ( ) has traditionally been linked to the concept of biomedical research data, however, the concept of FAIR should be applied more broadly to include tools use to analyze and process data. There needs to be more emphasis on facilitating sharing of data analysis tools and workflows to truly facilitate reproducibility. Indeed, there is a plethora of tools with more being created every day. The field lacks a centralized tool repository to store tools/workflows (as well as their associated standards/languages) and assess the usability/reusuability of said tools.
