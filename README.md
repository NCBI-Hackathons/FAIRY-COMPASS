# FAIRY-COMPASS: FAIRness-Evaluation-of-NCBI-Hackathon-Digital-Objects-using-FAIRshake

## Premise
Assess the FAIRness of NCBI-Hackathon Tools on GitHub (and possibly DockStore)

## Abstract

FAIR (Findable, Accessable, Interoperable, Re-usable) concepts have traditionally been linked to the concept of biomedical research data; we argue the same ideology should be applied to bioinformatics tools as well. 
An increased emphasis on strengths and weaknesses of various tools and workflows can better enable reproducibility. 
Such an assessment is important for the following reasons:

1. Alerts tool owners to potential pitfalls that may prevent future users using their tools
2. Allows administrators to automatically assess the overall usability or FAIRness of a suite of tools
3. Assists future users searching for tools by displaying a fairSHAKE badge for the tool in question

To analyze the FAIR-ness of tools, we used a tool called FAIRshake, previously developed as part of the NIH Data Commons project. 
We created and ran a script to scan the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)-Hackathon GitHub. 
We also did the same for Dockstore. 


## Intro

### FAIR
Conceptualized in 2016, the FAIR - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability - principles were intended to facilitate effective data sharing in the field of biomedical research (Wilkinson et al. 2016). 
Discussions have been underway on how to operationalize these ideals. 
Beyond data FAIR concepts there is increasing awareness that the tools used to work with data can also benefit from application of the FAIR principles. 
Repositories such as GitHub and Dockstore can enable and support the FAIR principals but engagement by tool developers and administrators is still needed. 

### What is FAIRshake
FAIRshake is a web tool and framework for facilitating FAIRness evaluations of digital objects by organizing reusable metrics into rubrics and digital objects into projects. 
It collects assessments and renders an insignia representing the aggregation of all FAIR assessments. 
This insignia is visible through the FAIRshake webpage, chrome extension, bookmarklet, and on participating websites. 
By facilitating the development of FAIR rubrics with metric reuse and enabling user-driven semi-automated assessments of digital resources the community, can strive to become more FAIR.

#### Metrics

#### Challenges and Assumptions
We have chosen to assess tools based on metrics that can be automatically assessed through script rather than subject tool owners and site admins to manual assessment of tools.
